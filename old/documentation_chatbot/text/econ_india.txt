This is characterised as dirigism, in the form of the Licence Raj.[61][62] The end of the Cold War and an acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 led to the adoption of a broad economic liberalisation in India and indicative planning.[63][64] Since the start of the 21st century, annual average GDP growth has been 6% to 7%.[59], India has about 1,900 public sector company,[65] Indian state has complete control and ownership of railways, highways; majority control and stake in banking,[66] insurance,[67] farming,[68] dairy, fertilizers & chemicals,[69] airports,[70] nuclear, mining, digitization, defense, steel, rare earths, water, electricity, oil and gas industries and power plants,[71] and has substantial control over digitalization, Broadband as national infrastructure, telecommunication, supercomputing, space, port and shipping industries,[72] among other industries, were effectively nationalised in the mid-1950s.[73][61][62]

The leading sectors for FDI inflows were the service sector, the computer industry, and the telecom industry.[87] India has free trade agreements with several nations and blocs, including ASEAN, SAFTA, Mercosur, South Korea, Japan, Australia, UAE, and several others which are in effect or under negotiating stage.[88][89] In recent years, independent economists and financial institutions have accused the government of manipulating various economic data, especially GDP growth rate.[90][91][92][93][94][95][96]
