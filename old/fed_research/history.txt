question = what kind of models has the federal reserve created
answer = The Federal Reserve has created stress testing supervisory models that are independent, forward-looking, and consistent across firms. These models are developed using detailed data provided by firms and are designed to assess each firm's capital adequacy under stress. The models are evaluated by an independent team of Federal Reserve model reviewers.

question = what are the models that the fed has created
answer = The Federal Reserve has developed stress testing models under an industry-level approach using data from financial institutions, focusing on consistent, comparable, and forward-looking projections. These models are designed to provide independent, credible assessments of each firm's capital adequacy under stress and instill public confidence in the banking system. For the 2024 stress test, notable updates were made to supervisory models, including adjustments to first-lien mortgage models and trading IDL models.

question = what are the main parameters of the fed's model 
answer = The main parameters of the Fed's model include being independent, forward-looking, consistent and comparable across firms, generated from simple approaches, robust and stable, conservative, and able to capture the effect of economic stress. The models also rely on detailed portfolio data provided by firms and data collected on regulatory reports and proprietary industry data. Notable updates to the supervisory models include changes to the first-lien mortgage model, the international bank and charge cards portfolio model, and the trading IDL model.

question = how does the fed utilize mortgage information 
answer = The Federal Reserve utilizes mortgage information by mapping FICO® Scores as an input to its first-lien mortgage loss model, using them as the most widely used credit scores in historical data. The Fed has updated its supervisory models for the 2024 stress test, including changes to the first-lien mortgage model to control for macroeconomic data variations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The models rely on detailed portfolio data to provide independent assessments of each firm's capital adequacy under stress.
