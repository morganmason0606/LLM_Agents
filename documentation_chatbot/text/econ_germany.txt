Germany is rich in timber, lignite, potash, and salt. Some minor sources of natural gas are being exploited in the state of Lower Saxony. Until German reunification, the German Democratic Republic mined for uranium in the Ore Mountains (see also: SAG/SDAG Wismut). Energy in Germany is sourced predominantly by fossil fuels (30%), with wind power in second place, then gas, solar, biomass (wood and biofuels), and hydro.[37] Germany is the first major industrialised nation to commit to the renewable energy transition called Energiewende. Germany is the leading producer of wind turbines in the world.[38] Renewables produced 46% of electricity consumed in Germany (as of 2019).[39] Germany has been called "the world's first major renewable energy economy".[40][41] Germany has the world's second-largest gold reserve, with over 3,000 tonnes of gold.[42] Germany spends around 3.14% of GDP on advance research and development across various sectors of the economy.[43][44] It is also the world's second-largest high-technology exporter.[45]
