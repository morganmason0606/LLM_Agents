      "answer =  The history of the United States and the United Kingdom has been marked by various events and conflicts, with the War of 1812 being a significant point of contention between the two nations. The long-term results of the war were generally satisfactory for both countries, leading to peaceful relations for the rest of the 19th century. In the 20th century, spurred by multiple world conflicts, the US and UK became close allies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rushâ€“Bagot Treaty of 1817 demilitarized the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain, laying the basis for a demilitarized boundary that remains in effect to this day. The historian Donald Hickey suggests that Britain's long-term policy of rapprochement with the US in the 19th century was driven by the belief that accommodating the US was the best way to defend Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "The War of 1812 had significant impacts on both nations. In the US, it led to a period known as the Era of Good Feelings, characterized by nationalism and a desire for national unity. The victory at the Battle of New Orleans further fueled nationalism. In the UK, the war was considered a sideshow due to the ongoing conflict with the French Empire under Napoleon. The British blockade of French trade, along with the dominance of the Royal Navy, contributed to the perception of the War of 1812 as a minor theatre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the War of 1812 played a role in shaping the relationship between the US and UK, with both nations quickly resuming trade and developing a growing friendship after the conflict. The historiography of the war reflects differing interpretations of the outcome, with both British and American perspectives claiming victory in the conflict.\n",
