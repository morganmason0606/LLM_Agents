       " Document(page_content='Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\nIn addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating \\ncapital utilization and adequacy, including: \\n•Tangible common equity to tangible assets \\n•Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets\\n•Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, reflecting the full implementation of the current expected credit losses \\nmethodology, and\\n•Return on tangible common equity.\\nThese measures are viewed by management as useful additional methods of evaluating the Company’s utilization of its capital \\nheld and the level of capital available to withstand unexpected negative market or economic conditions. Additionally, \\npresentation of these measures allows investors, analysts and banking regulators to assess the Company’s capital position and \\nuse of capital relative to other financial services companies. These measures are not defined in generally accepted accounting \\nprinciples (“GAAP”) or are not currently effective or defined in banking regulations. In addition, certain of these measures differ \\nfrom currently effective capital ratios defined by banking regulations principally in that the currently effective ratios, which are \\nsubject to certain transitional provisions, temporarily exclude the impact of the 2020 adoption of accounting guidance related to \\nimpairment of financial instruments based on the current expected credit losses methodology. As a result, these measures \\ndisclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes this information helps \\ninvestors assess trends in the Company’s capital utilization and adequacy.\\nThe Company also discloses net interest income and related ratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which may also \\nbe considered non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes this presentation to be the preferred industry \\nmeasurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison  of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-\\nexempt sources. In addition, certain performance measures, including the efficiency ratio, tangible efficiency ratio and net \\ninterest margin, utilize net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.\\nThe adjusted return on average assets, adjusted return on tangible common equity, adjusted efficiency ratio, adjusted net \\nincome and adjusted diluted earnings per common share exclude notable items. Management uses these measures in their \\nanalysis of the Company’s performance and believes these measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations \\nand enhance comparability of results with prior periods.\\nThere may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider \\nthe consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this press release in their entirety, and not to \\nrely on any single financial measure. A table follows that shows the Company’s calculation of these non-GAAP financial \\nmeasures.\\nU.S. Bancorp First  Quarter 2024  Results\\n15', metadata={'source': './reports/24Q1USBANK\\\\Q1-2024-Earnings-Release.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",

Return on \\naverage assets and return on average common equity were \\n0.81 percent  and 10.0 percent , respectively, for the first \\nquarter of 2024 , compared with 1.03 percent  and 14.1 \\npercent , respectively, for the first quarter of 2023 . The results \\nfor the first quarter of 2024 included the impact of $265 \\nmillion ($199 million net-of-tax) of notable items, including \\n$155 million  of merger and integration charges associated \\nwith the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank, N.A. (“MUB”) and \\na $110 million charge for the anticipated increase in the FDIC \\nspecial assessment to recover losses to the Deposit \\nInsurance Fund related to certain 2023 bank failures. \\nCombined, these items decreased diluted earnings per \\ncommon share by $0.12. The results for the first quarter of \\n2023 included the impact of $244 million  ($183 million net-of-\\ntax) of merger and integration charges, which decreased \\ndiluted earnings per common share by $0.12.\\nTotal net revenue for the first quarter of 2024  was $460 \\nmillion  (6.4 percent ) lower than the first quarter of 2023 , \\nreflecting a 14.0 percent  decrease in net interest income and \\na 7.7 percent  increase in noninterest income. The decrease \\nin net interest income from the first quarter of 2023  was \\nprimarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on deposit \\nmix and pricing, partially offset by higher rates on earning \\nassets. The increase in noninterest income was driven by \\nhigher fee revenue across most categories. \\nNoninterest expense in the first quarter of 2024  was $96 \\nmillion  (2.1 percent ) lower than the first quarter of 2023 , \\nprimarily due to prudent expense management, continued \\nfocus on operational efficiency, and synergies from the MUB \\nacquisition, partially offset by the impact of the FDIC special \\nassessment charge and higher compensation and employee \\nbenefits expense to support business growth. \\nThe provision for credit losses for the first quarter of 2024  \\nof $553 million  was $126 million  (29.5 percent ) higher than \\nthe first quarter of 2023 , driven by normalization in the credit \\nenvironment, partially offset by relative stability in the \\neconomic outlook. Net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2024  \\nwere $488 million , compared with $373 million  in the first \\nquarter of 2023 .

The decrease was \\nprimarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on deposit mix and pricing, partially offset by higher rates on earning \\nassets. Average earning assets for the first quarter of 2024  \\nwere $11.5 billion  (1.9 percent ) lower than the first quarter of \\n2023 , reflecting decreases in loans and investment \\nsecurities, partially offset by an increase in interest-bearing \\ndeposits with banks. The net interest margin, on a taxable-\\nequivalent basis, in the first quarter of 2024  was 2.70 \\npercent , compared with 3.10 percent  in the first quarter of \\n2023 . The decrease in net interest margin from the first \\nquarter of 2023  was primarily due to the impact of deposit \\nmix and pricing. Refer to the “Consolidated Daily Average \\nBalance Sheet and Related Yields and Rates” table for \\nfurther information on net interest income. \\nAverage total loans in the first quarter of 2024  were $15.7 \\nbillion  (4.1 percent ) lower than the first quarter of 2023 . The \\ndecrease was primarily due to lower other retail loans, \\ncommercial loans and commercial real estate loans, partially \\noffset by higher credit card loans. Average other retail loans \\ndecreased $9.9 billion  (18.5 percent ), driven by lower auto \\nloans primarily due to balance sheet repositioning and \\ncapital management actions taken in the second quarter of \\n2023. Average commercial loans decreased $4.9 billion  (3.6 \\npercent ) primarily due to decreased demand as corporate \\ncustomers accessed the capital markets. Average \\ncommercial real estate loans decreased $2.6 billion  (4.6 \\npercent ) primarily due to payoffs exceeding a reduced level \\nof new originations. Average credit cards loans increased \\n$2.4 billion  (9.3 percent ) primarily driven by higher spend \\nvolume and lower payment rates.\\nAverage investment securities in the first quarter of 2024  \\nwere $4.9 billion  (2.9 percent ) lower than the first quarter of \\n2023 , primarily due to balance sheet repositioning and \\nliquidity management. \\nAverage total deposits for the first quarter of 2024  were \\n$7.3 billion  (1.4 percent ) lower than the first quarter of 2023 . \\nAverage noninterest-bearing deposits for the first quarter of \\n2024  were $45.0 billion  (34.6 percent ) lower than the first \\nquarter of 2023 , driven by decreases in Wealth, Corporate, \\nCommercial and Institutional Banking, and Consumer and \\nBusiness Banking balances. Average time deposits for the \\nfirst quarter of 2024  were $19.7 billion  (55.5 percent ) higher \\nthan the first quarter of 2023, mainly due to increases in \\nConsumer and Business Banking balances, partially offset by \\ndecreases in Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional \\nBanking balances. Changes in time deposits are primarily \\nrelated to those deposits managed as an alternative to other \\nfunding sources, based largely on relative pricing and \\nliquidity characteristics.

The decrease in loans held for \\nsale was principally due to a lower level of mortgage loan \\nclosings in the first quarter of 2024 , compared with the fourth \\nquarter of 2023 . Almost all of the residential mortgage loans \\nthe Company originates or purchases for sale follow \\nguidelines that allow the loans to be sold into existing, highly \\nliquid secondary markets, in particular in government agency \\ntransactions and to government-sponsored enterprises \\n(“GSEs”). \\nInvestment Securities  Investment securities totaled $155.4 \\nbillion  at March\\xa031, 2024 , compared with $153.8 billion  at \\nDecember\\xa031, 2023 .

The Company’s \\nBoard of Directors has approved a risk management \\nframework which establishes governance and risk \\nmanagement requirements for all risk-taking activities. This \\nframework includes Company and business line risk appetite \\nstatements which set boundaries for the types and amount of \\nrisk that may be undertaken in pursuing business objectives \\nand initiatives. The Board of Directors, primarily through its \\nRisk Management Committee, oversees performance relative \\nto the risk management framework, risk appetite statements, \\nand other policy requirements. \\nThe Executive Risk Committee (“ERC”), which is chaired \\nby the Chief Risk Officer and includes the Chief Executive \\nOfficer and other members of the executive management \\nteam, oversees execution against the risk management \\nframework and risk appetite statements.

Senior operating committees have also been \\nestablished, each responsible for overseeing a specified \\ncategory of risk. \\nThe Company’s most prominent risk exposures are credit, \\ninterest rate, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, \\nstrategic, and reputation. Credit risk is the risk of loss \\nassociated with a change in the credit profile or the failure of \\na borrower or counterparty to meet its contractual \\nobligations. Interest rate risk is the current or prospective risk \\nto earnings and capital, or market valuations, arising from the \\nimpact of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from \\nfluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and \\nsecurity prices that may result in changes in the values of \\nfinancial instruments, such as trading and available-for-sale \\ninvestment securities, mortgage loans held for sale \\n(“MLHFS”), mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) and \\nderivatives that are accounted for on a fair value basis. \\nLiquidity risk is the risk that financial condition or overall \\nsafety and soundness is adversely affected by the \\nCompany’s inability, or perceived inability, to meet its cash \\nflow obligations in a timely and complete manner in either \\nnormal or stressed conditions. Operational risk is the risk to \\ncurrent or projected financial condition and resilience arising \\nfrom inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, \\npeople (including human errors or misconduct), or adverse \\nexternal events, including the risk of loss resulting from \\nbreaches in data security. Operational risk can also include \\nthe risk of loss due to failures by third parties with which the \\nCompany does business. Compliance risk is the risk that the \\nCompany may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, financial \\nlosses, and reputational damage if it fails to adhere to \\ncompliance requirements and the Company’s compliance \\npolicies. Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected \\nfinancial condition and resilience arising from adverse \\nbusiness decisions, poor implementation of business \\ndecisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the \\nbanking industry and operating environment. Reputation risk \\nis the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or \\nfranchise or enterprise value arising from negative public \\nopinion. This risk may impair the Company’s competitiveness \\nby affecting its ability to establish new relationships or \\nservices, or continue serving existing relationships. In \\naddition to the risks identified above, other risk factors exist \\nthat may impact the Company. Refer to “Risk Factors” in the \\nCompany’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended \\nDecember\\xa031, 2023 , for a detailed discussion of these \\nfactors. \\nThe Company’s Board and management-level \\ngovernance committees are supported by a “three lines of \\ndefense” model for establishing effective checks and \\nbalances. The first line of defense, the business lines, \\nmanages risks in conformity with established limits and policy \\nrequirements. In turn, business line leaders and their risk \\nofficers establish programs to ensure conformity with these \\nlimits and policy requirements. The second line of defense, \\nwhich includes the Chief Risk Officer’s organization as well \\nas policy and oversight activities of corporate support \\nfunctions, translates risk appetite and strategy into actionable \\nrisk limits and policies. The second line of defense monitors \\nfirst line of defense conformity with limits and policies and provides reporting and escalation of emerging risks and \\nother concerns to senior management and the Risk \\nManagement Committee of the Board of Directors. The third \\nline of defense, internal audit, is responsible for providing the \\nAudit Committee of the Board of Directors and senior \\nmanagement with independent assessment and assurance \\nregarding the effectiveness of the Company’s governance, \\nrisk management and control processes. \\nManagement regularly provides reports to the Risk \\nManagement Committee of the Board of Directors. The Risk \\nManagement Committee discusses with management the \\nCompany’s risk management performance and provides a \\nsummary of key risks to the entire Board of Directors, \\ncovering the status of existing matters, areas of potential \\nfuture concern and specific information on certain types of \\nloss events. The Risk Management Committee considers \\nquarterly reports by management assessing the Company’s \\nperformance relative to the risk appetite statements and the \\nassociated risk limits, including: \\n•Macroeconomic environment and other qualitative \\nconsiderations, such as regulatory and compliance \\nchanges, litigation developments, geopolitical events, and \\ntechnology and cybersecurity; \\n•Credit measures, including adversely rated and \\nnonperforming loans, leveraged transactions, credit \\nconcentrations and lending limits; \\n•Interest rate and market risk, including market value and \\nnet income simulation, and trading-related Value at Risk \\n(“VaR”); \\n•Liquidity risk, including funding projections under various \\nstressed scenarios; \\n•Operational and compliance risk, including losses \\nstemming from events such as fraud, processing errors, \\ncontrol breaches, breaches in data security or adverse \\nbusiness decisions, as well as reporting on technology \\nperformance, and various legal and regulatory compliance \\nmeasures; \\n•Capital ratios and projections, including regulatory \\nmeasures and stressed scenarios; and \\n•Strategic and reputation risk considerations, impacts and \\nresponses. \\nCredit Risk Management  The Company’s strategy for credit \\nrisk management includes well-defined, centralized credit \\npolicies, uniform underwriting criteria, and ongoing risk \\nmonitoring and review processes for all commercial and \\nconsumer credit exposures. The strategy also emphasizes \\ndiversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, \\nregular credit examinations and management reviews of \\nloans exhibiting deterioration of credit quality. In evaluating \\nits credit risk, the Company considers changes, if any, in \\nunderwriting activities, the loan portfolio composition \\n(including product mix and geographic, industry or \\ncustomer-specific factors), collateral values, trends in loan \\nperformance and macroeconomic factors, such as changes \\nin unemployment rates, gross domestic product levels, \\ninflation, interest rates and consumer bankruptcy filings.

       " Document(page_content='In addition, credit quality ratings, as defined by the \\nCompany, are an important part of the Company’s overall \\ncredit risk management and evaluation of its allowance for \\ncredit losses. Loans with a pass rating represent those loans \\nnot classified on the Company’s rating scale for problem \\ncredits, as minimal credit risk has been identified. Loans with \\na special mention or classified rating, including consumer \\nlending and small business loans that are 90 days or more \\npast due and still accruing, nonaccrual loans and loans in a \\njunior lien position that are current but are behind a first lien \\nposition on nonaccrual, encompass all loans held by the \\nCompany that it considers to have a potential or well-defined \\nweakness that may put full collection of contractual cash \\nflows at risk.

The Company \\ncategorizes its loan portfolio into two segments, which is the \\nlevel at which it develops and documents a systematic \\nmethodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. \\nThe Company’s two loan portfolio segments are commercial \\nlending and consumer lending. \\nThe commercial lending segment includes loans and \\nleases made to small business, middle market, large \\ncorporate, commercial real estate, financial institution, non-\\nprofit and public sector customers. Key risk characteristics \\nrelevant to commercial lending segment loans include the \\nindustry and geography of the borrower’s business, purpose \\nof the loan, repayment source, borrower’s debt capacity and \\nfinancial flexibility, loan covenants, and nature of pledged \\ncollateral, if any, as well as macroeconomic factors such as \\nunemployment rates, gross domestic product levels, \\ncorporate bond spreads and long-term interest rates. These \\nrisk characteristics, among others, are considered in \\ndetermining estimates about the likelihood of default by the \\nborrowers and the severity of loss in the event of default. The \\nCompany considers these risk characteristics in assigning \\ninternal risk ratings to, or forecasting losses on, these loans, \\nwhich are the significant factors in determining the allowance \\nfor credit losses for loans in the commercial lending segment. \\nThe consumer lending segment represents loans and \\nleases made to consumer customers, including residential \\nmortgages, credit card loans, and other retail loans such as \\nrevolving consumer lines, auto loans and leases and home \\nequity loans and lines. Key risk characteristics relevant to \\nconsumer lending segment loans primarily relate to the \\nborrowers’ capacity and willingness to repay and include \\nunemployment rates, consumer bankruptcy filings, \\nhousehold debt levels, real disposable income and other \\nmacroeconomic factors, customer payment history and credit \\nscores, effect of higher interest rates on variable rate or adjustable rate loans, and in some cases, updated loan-to-\\nvalue (“LTV”) information reflecting current market conditions \\non secured loans. These and other risk characteristics are \\nreflected in forecasts of delinquency levels, bankruptcies and \\nlosses which are the primary factors in determining the \\nallowance for credit losses for the consumer lending \\nsegment. \\nThe Company further disaggregates its loan portfolio \\nsegments into various classes based on their underlying risk \\ncharacteristics. The two classes within the commercial \\nlending segment are commercial loans and commercial real \\nestate loans. The three classes within the consumer lending \\nsegment are residential mortgages, credit card loans and \\nother retail loans. \\nThe Company’s consumer lending segment utilizes \\nseveral distinct business processes and channels to \\noriginate consumer credit, including traditional branch \\nlending, mobile and online banking, indirect lending, alliance \\npartnerships and correspondent banks. Each distinct \\nunderwriting and origination activity manages unique credit \\nrisk characteristics and prices its loan production \\ncommensurate with the differing risk profiles. \\nResidential mortgage originations are generally limited to \\nprime borrowers and are performed through the Company’s \\nbranches, loan production offices, mobile and online \\nservices, and a wholesale network of originators. The \\nCompany may retain residential mortgage loans it originates \\non its balance sheet or sell the loans into the secondary \\nmarket while retaining the servicing rights and customer \\nrelationships. Utilizing the secondary markets enables the \\nCompany to effectively reduce its credit and other asset/\\nliability risks. For residential mortgages that are retained in \\nthe Company’s portfolio and for home equity and second \\nmortgages, credit risk is managed by adherence to LTV and \\nborrower credit criteria during the underwriting process. \\nThe Company estimates updated LTV information on its \\noutstanding residential mortgages quarterly, based on a \\nmethod that combines automated valuation model updates \\nand relevant home price indices. LTV is the ratio of the loan’s \\noutstanding principal balance to the current estimate of \\nproperty value. For home equity and second mortgages, \\ncombined loan-to-value (“CLTV”) is the combination of the \\nfirst mortgage original principal balance and the second lien \\noutstanding principal balance, relative to the current estimate \\nof property value. Certain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV, \\nprimarily due to lack of availability of relevant automated \\nvaluation model and/or home price indices values, or lack of \\nnecessary valuation data on acquired loans. \\nU.S. Bancorp 9', metadata={'source': './reports/24Q1USBANK\\\\Q1-2024-Form-10-Q.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",

In most cases the modification is either a \\nconcessionary reduction in interest rate, extension of the \\nmaturity date or reduction in the principal balance that would \\notherwise not be considered. \\nModified loans accrue interest if the borrower complies \\nwith the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated \\nrepayment performance at a level commensurate with the \\nmodified terms over several payment cycles, which is \\ngenerally six months or greater. \\nThe Company continues to work with customers to modify \\nloans for borrowers who are experiencing financial \\ndifficulties. Many of the Company’s loan modifications are \\ndetermined on a case-by-case basis in connection with \\nongoing loan collection processes. The modifications vary \\nwithin each of the Company’s loan classes. Commercial \\nlending segment modifications generally include extensions \\nof the maturity date and may be accompanied by an \\nincrease or decrease to the interest rate. The Company may also work with the borrower to make other changes to the \\nloan to mitigate losses, such as obtaining additional collateral \\nand/or guarantees to support the loan. \\nThe Company has also implemented certain residential \\nmortgage loan modification programs. The Company \\nmodifies residential mortgage loans under Federal Housing \\nAdministration, United States Department of Veterans Affairs, \\nand its own internal programs. Under these programs, the \\nCompany offers qualifying homeowners the opportunity to \\npermanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable \\nmonthly payments. These modifications may include \\nadjustments to interest rates, conversion of adjustable rates \\nto fixed rates, extensions of maturity dates or deferrals of \\npayments, capitalization of accrued interest and/or \\noutstanding advances, or in limited situations, partial \\nforgiveness of loan principal. In most instances, participation \\nin residential mortgage loan modification programs requires \\nthe customer to complete a short-term trial period. A \\npermanent loan modification is contingent on the customer \\nsuccessfully completing the trial period arrangement, and the \\nloan documents are not modified until that time. \\n12 U.S. Bancorp', metadata={'source': './reports/24Q1USBANK\\\\Q1-2024-Form-10-Q.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Credit card and other retail loan modifications are \\ngenerally part of distinct modification programs providing \\ncustomers modification solutions over a specified time \\nperiod, generally up to 60 months. \\nThe Company also makes short-term modifications, in \\nlimited circumstances, to assist borrowers experiencing \\ntemporary hardships. Short-term consumer lending \\nmodification programs include payment reductions, deferrals \\nof up to three past due payments, and the ability to return to \\ncurrent status if the borrower makes required payments. The \\nCompany may also make short-term modifications to \\ncommercial lending loans, with the most common \\nmodification being an extension of the maturity date of three \\nmonths or less. Such extensions generally are used when the \\nmaturity date is imminent and the borrower is experiencing \\nsome level of financial stress, but the Company believes the \\nborrower will pay all contractual amounts owed. \\nNonperforming Assets  The level of nonperforming assets \\nrepresents another indicator of the potential for future credit \\nlosses.

The ratio of total loan \\nnet charge-offs to average loans outstanding on an \\nannualized basis for the first quarter of 2024  was 0.53 \\npercent , compared with 0.39 percent  for the first quarter of \\n2023 .\\nAnalysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit \\nLosses  The allowance for credit losses is established for \\ncurrent expected credit losses on the Company’s loan and \\nlease portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments. The \\nallowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives \\nof the applicable assets, inclusive of expected recoveries. \\nThe allowance for credit losses is increased through \\nprovisions charged to earnings and reduced by net charge-\\noffs. \\nManagement evaluates the appropriateness of the \\nallowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis. Multiple \\neconomic scenarios are considered over a three-year \\nreasonable and supportable forecast period, which includes \\nincreasing consideration of historical loss experience over \\nyears two and three. These economic scenarios are \\nconstructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic \\nvariables, and loss estimates are produced that consider the \\nhistorical correlation of those economic variables with credit \\nlosses. After the forecast period, the Company fully reverts to \\nlong-term historical loss experience, adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and \\nlease portfolio, to estimate losses over the remaining life of \\nthe portfolio. The economic scenarios are updated at least \\nquarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable \\nestimates from better to worse than current expectations. \\nScenarios are weighted based on the Company’s \\nexpectation of economic conditions for the foreseeable future \\nand reflect significant judgment and consideration of \\neconomic forecast uncertainty. Final loss estimates also \\nconsider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the \\nscenarios, due to the unique aspects of current conditions \\nand expectations. These factors may include, but are not \\nlimited to, changes in borrower behavior or conditions in \\nspecific lending segments, loan servicing practices, \\nregulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and monetary policy \\nactions. \\nBecause business processes and credit risks associated \\nwith unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same \\nas for loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to \\nestimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments, which \\nis included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance \\nSheet. Both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for \\nunfunded credit commitments are included in the Company’s \\nanalysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios. \\nThe allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forward-\\nlooking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors \\naffecting lifetime credit losses. These factors include, but are \\nnot limited to, macroeconomic variables such as \\nunemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic \\nproduct levels, inflation, interest rates, and corporate bond \\nspreads, as well as loan and borrower characteristics, such \\nas internal risk ratings on commercial loans and consumer \\ncredit scores, delinquency status, collateral type and \\nU.S. Bancorp 15', metadata={'source': './reports/24Q1USBANK\\\\Q1-2024-Form-10-Q.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='available valuation information, consideration of end-of-term \\nlosses on lease residuals, and the remaining term of the loan, \\nadjusted for expected prepayments. For each loan portfolio, \\nincluding those loans modified under various loan \\nmodification programs, model estimates are adjusted as \\nnecessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio \\ncomposition, lending policies, underwriting standards, risk \\nmanagement practices, economic conditions or other factors \\nthat may affect the accuracy of the model. Expected credit \\nloss estimates also include consideration of expected cash \\nrecoveries on loans previously charged-off or expected \\nrecoveries on collateral-dependent loans where recovery is \\nexpected through sale of the collateral at fair value less \\nselling costs. Where loans do not exhibit similar risk \\ncharacteristics, an individual analysis is performed to \\nconsider expected credit losses. \\nThe allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans \\ngreater than $5 million in the commercial lending segment is \\nbased on an analysis utilizing expected cash flows \\ndiscounted using the original effective interest rate, the \\nobservable market price of the loan, or the fair value of the \\ncollateral, less selling costs, for collateral-dependent loans as \\nappropriate. \\nWhen evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for \\ncredit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position, \\nthe Company considers the delinquency and modification \\nstatus of the first lien, based on either servicing data for first \\nlien accounts serviced by the Company or the status of first \\nlien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau \\nfiles when the first lien is not serviced by the Company. This \\ninformation is considered within the overall assessment of \\neconomic conditions, problem loans, recent loss experience \\nand other factors in determining the allowance for credit \\nlosses. \\nWhen a loan portfolio is purchased, the acquired loans \\nare divided into those considered purchased with more than \\ninsignificant credit deterioration (“PCD”) and those not \\nconsidered PCD. An allowance is established for each \\npopulation and considers product mix, risk characteristics of \\nthe portfolio and delinquency status and refreshed LTV ratios \\nwhen possible. PCD loans also consider whether the loan \\nhas experienced a charge-off, bankruptcy or significant \\ndeterioration since origination. The allowance established for \\npurchased loans not considered PCD is recognized through \\nprovision expense upon acquisition, whereas the allowance \\nestablished for loans considered PCD at acquisition is offset \\nby an increase in the basis of the acquired loans. Any \\nsubsequent increases and decreases in the allowance \\nrelated to purchased loans, regardless of PCD status, are \\nrecognized through provision expense, with charge-offs \\ncharged to the allowance. The Company had a total net book \\nbalance of $3.0 billion of PCD loans, primarily related to the \\nMUB acquisition, included in its loan portfolio at March\\xa031, \\n2024 . \\nThe Company’s methodology for determining the \\nappropriate allowance for credit losses also considers the \\nimprecision inherent in the methodologies used and \\nallocated to the various loan portfolios. As a result, amounts \\ndetermined under the methodologies described above are \\nadjusted by management to consider the potential impact of \\nother qualitative factors not captured in quantitative model adjustments which include, but are not limited to, the \\nfollowing: model imprecision, imprecision in economic \\nscenario assumptions, and emerging risks related to either \\nchanges in the economic environment that are affecting \\nspecific portfolios, or changes in portfolio concentrations \\nover time that may affect model performance. The \\nconsideration of these items results in adjustments to \\nallowance amounts included in the Company’s allowance for \\ncredit losses for each loan portfolio. \\nAlthough the Company determined the amount of each \\nelement of the allowance separately and considers this \\nprocess to be an important credit management tool, the \\nentire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire \\nloan portfolio. The actual amount of losses can vary \\nsignificantly from the estimated amounts. \\nAt March\\xa031, 2024 , the allowance for credit losses was \\n$7.9 billion , compared with an allowance of $7.8 billion  at \\nDecember\\xa031, 2023 . The $65 million  (0.8 percent ) increase in \\nthe allowance for credit losses at March\\xa031, 2024 , compared \\nwith December\\xa031, 2023 , was primarily driven by credit \\nmigration in consumer and small business cards. The \\nCompany continued to monitor economic uncertainty related \\nto high interest rates, persistent inflationary pressures and \\nother economic factors that affect the financial strength of \\ncorporate and consumer borrowers. Commercial real estate \\nvaluations were also affected by rising interest rates and the \\nchanging demand for office properties. The Company has \\nmonitored the commercial real estate office portfolio and \\nestablished an allowance to loan coverage ratio of \\napproximately 10 percent at March 31, 2024 and December \\n31, 2023. In addition to these broad economic factors, \\nexpected loss estimates considered various factors including \\ncustomer specific information impacting changes in risk \\nratings, projected delinquencies and the impact of economic \\ndeterioration on selected borrowers’ liquidity and ability to \\nrepay.\\nThe ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end \\nloans was 2.11 percent  at March\\xa031, 2024 , compared with \\n2.10 percent  at December\\xa031, 2023 . The ratio of the \\nallowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 454 \\npercent at March\\xa031, 2024 , compared with 541 percent at \\nDecember\\xa031, 2023 . The ratio of the allowance for credit \\nlosses to annualized loan net charge-offs was 403 percent at \\nMarch\\xa031, 2024 , compared with 411 percent of full year 2023  \\nnet charge-offs at December\\xa031, 2023 . \\nEconomic conditions considered in estimating the \\nallowance for credit losses at March\\xa031, 2024  included \\nchanges in projected gross domestic product and \\nunemployment levels. These factors were evaluated through \\na combination of quantitative calculations using multiple \\neconomic scenarios and additional qualitative assessments \\nthat considered the degree of economic uncertainty in the \\ncurrent environment.

Interest Rate Risk Management  In the banking industry, \\nchanges in interest rates are a significant risk that can impact \\nearnings as well as the safety and soundness of an entity. \\nThe Company manages its exposure to changes in interest \\nrates through asset and liability management activities within \\nguidelines established by its Asset Liability Management \\nCommittee (“ALCO”) and approved by the Board of \\nDirectors. The ALCO has the responsibility for approving and \\noverseeing compliance with the ALCO management policies, \\nincluding interest rate risk exposure. One way the Company \\nmeasures and analyzes its interest rate risk is through \\nanalysis of net interest income sensitivities across a range of \\nscenarios. \\nNet interest income sensitivity analysis includes \\nevaluating all of the Company’s assets and liabilities and off-\\nbalance sheet instruments, inclusive of new business activity \\nunder various interest rate scenarios that differ in the \\ndirection, amount and speed of change over time, as well as \\nthe overall shape of the yield curve. The balance sheet \\nincludes assumptions regarding loan and deposit volumes \\nand pricing which are based on quantitative analysis, \\nhistorical trends and management outlook and strategies. \\nDeposit balances, mix and pricing are dynamic across \\ninterest rate scenarios and will change both with the absolute \\nlevel of rates as well as the assumed interest rate shock. \\nDeposit pricing changes, commonly referred to as the \\ndeposit beta, represents the amount by which the Company’s \\ninterest-bearing deposit rates have or will change given a \\nchange in short-term market rates. Base case and net \\ninterest income sensitivities are reviewed monthly by the \\nALCO and are used to guide asset/liability management \\nstrategies. \\nThe Company also manages interest rate sensitivity by \\nutilizing market value of equity modeling, which measures the \\ndegree to which the market values of the Company’s assets \\nand liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments will change \\ngiven a change in interest rates. Management measures the \\nimpact of changes in market values due to interest rates \\nunder a number of scenarios, including immediate and \\nsustained parallel shifts, and flattening or steepening of the \\nyield curve. The Company manages its interest rate risk \\nposition by holding assets with desired interest rate risk \\ncharacteristics on its balance sheet, executing certain pricing \\nstrategies for loans and deposits and deploying investment \\nportfolio, funding and derivative strategies.\\nTable 9 summarizes the projected impact to net interest \\nincome over the next 12 months of various potential interest \\nrate changes. The sensitivity of the projected impact to net \\ninterest income over the next 12 months is dependent on \\nbalance sheet growth, product mix, deposit behavior, pricing \\nand funding decisions. From December 31, 2023 to March \\n31, 2024, interest rate sensitivity to higher rates decreased, \\nprimarily due to changes in deposit composition and rates \\npaid on deposits as a result of the elevated interest rate \\nenvironment throughout the first quarter of 2024. As of March \\n31, 2024, the Company is relatively neutral to further parallel \\nupward moves in interest rates while the sensitivity to lower \\nrates has improved driven by the projected repricing of the \\ndeposit portfolio in declining rate scenarios. While the \\nCompany utilizes models and assumptions based on \\nhistorical information and expected behaviors, actual \\noutcomes could vary significantly.\\nU.S. Bancorp 19\", metadata={'source': './reports/24Q1USBANK\\\\Q1-2024-Form-10-Q.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",

The Company \\nuses derivatives for asset and liability management purposes \\nprimarily in the following ways: \\n•To convert fixed-rate debt and available-for-sale \\ninvestment securities from fixed-rate payments to floating-\\nrate payments; \\n•To convert floating-rate loans and debt from floating-rate \\npayments to fixed-rate payments; \\n•To mitigate changes in value of the Company’s unfunded \\nmortgage loan commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs; \\n•To mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency \\ndenominated balances; and \\n•To mitigate the volatility of the Company’s net investment in \\nforeign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign \\ncurrency exchange rates. \\nIn addition, the Company enters into interest rate, foreign \\nexchange and commodity derivative contracts to support the \\nbusiness requirements of its customers (customer-related \\npositions). The Company minimizes the market and liquidity \\nrisks of customer-related positions by either entering into \\nsimilar offsetting positions with broker-dealers, or on a \\nportfolio basis by entering into other derivative or non-\\nderivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset the \\nexposure from these customer-related positions. The \\nCompany may enter into derivative contracts that are either \\nexchange-traded, centrally cleared through clearinghouses \\nor over-the-counter. The Company does not utilize derivatives \\nfor speculative purposes. \\nThe Company does not designate all of the derivatives \\nthat it enters into for risk management purposes as \\naccounting hedges because of the inefficiency of applying \\nthe accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value \\naccounting for the related hedged items. In particular, the \\nCompany enters into interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward \\ncommitments to buy to-be-announced securities (“TBAs”), \\nU.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options on U.S. \\nTreasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its \\nMSRs, but does not designate those derivatives as \\naccounting hedges. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to \\nConsolidated Financial Statements for additional information \\nregarding MSRs, including management of the changes in \\nfair value.\\nAdditionally, the Company uses forward commitments to \\nsell TBAs and other commitments to sell residential mortgage \\nloans at specified prices to economically hedge the interest \\nrate risk in its residential mortgage loan production activities. \\nThe forward commitments to sell and the unfunded mortgage loan commitments on loans intended to be sold are \\nconsidered derivatives under the accounting guidance \\nrelated to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging \\nactivities. The Company has elected the fair value option for \\nthe MLHFS. \\nDerivatives are subject to credit risk associated with \\ncounterparties to the contracts. Credit risk associated with \\nderivatives is measured by the Company based on the \\nprobability of counterparty default. The Company manages \\nthe credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its \\npositions among various counterparties, by entering into \\nmaster netting arrangements, and, where possible, by \\nrequiring collateral arrangements. The Company may also \\ntransfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps \\nto third parties through the use of risk participation \\nagreements. In addition, certain interest rate swaps, interest \\nrate forwards and credit contracts are required to be \\ncentrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate \\ncounterparty credit risk. The Company also mitigates the \\ncredit risk of its derivative positions, as well as the credit risk \\non loans or lending portfolios, through the use of credit \\ncontracts. \\nFor additional information on derivatives and hedging \\nactivities, refer to Notes 12 and 13 in the Notes to \\nConsolidated Financial Statements. \\nMarket Risk Management  In addition to interest rate risk, the \\nCompany is exposed to other forms of market risk, principally \\nrelated to trading activities which support customers’ \\nstrategies to manage their own foreign currency, interest rate \\nrisk, commodities risk and funding activities. For purposes of \\nits internal capital adequacy assessment process, the \\nCompany considers risk arising from its trading activities, as \\nwell as the remeasurement volatility of foreign currency \\ndenominated balances included on its Consolidated Balance \\nSheet (collectively, “Covered Positions”), employing \\nmethodologies consistent with the requirements of regulatory \\nrules for market risk. The Company’s Market Risk Committee \\n(“MRC”), within the framework of the ALCO, oversees market \\nrisk management. The MRC monitors and reviews the \\nCompany’s Covered Positions and establishes policies for \\nmarket risk management, including exposure limits for each \\nportfolio. The Company uses a VaR approach to measure \\ngeneral market risk. Theoretically, VaR represents the \\nstatistical risk of loss the Company has to adverse market \\nmovements over a one-day time horizon. The Company uses \\nthe Historical Simulation method to calculate VaR for its \\nCovered Positions measured at the ninety-ninth percentile \\nusing a one-year look-back period for distributions derived \\nfrom past market data. The market factors used in the \\ncalculations include those pertinent to market risks inherent \\nin the underlying trading portfolios, principally those that \\naffect the Company’s corporate bond trading business, \\nforeign currency transaction business, client derivatives \\n20 U.S. Bancorp', metadata={'source': './reports/24Q1USBANK\\\\Q1-2024-Form-10-Q.pdf', 'page': 20}),\n",

The parent company obtains \\nfunding to meet its obligations from dividends collected from \\nits subsidiaries and the issuance of debt and capital \\nsecurities. The Company establishes limits for the minimal \\nnumber of months into the future where the parent company \\ncan meet existing and forecasted obligations with cash and \\nsecurities held that can be readily monetized. The Company \\nmeasures and manages this limit in both normal and adverse \\nconditions. The Company maintains sufficient funding to \\nmeet expected capital and debt service obligations for 24 \\nmonths without the support of dividends from subsidiaries \\nand assuming access to the wholesale markets is \\nmaintained. The Company maintains sufficient liquidity to \\nmeet its capital and debt service obligations for 12 months \\nunder adverse conditions without the support of dividends \\nfrom subsidiaries or access to the wholesale markets. The \\nparent company is currently in excess of required liquidity \\nminimums. \\nAt March\\xa031, 2024 , parent company long-term debt \\noutstanding was $35.7 billion , compared with $34.3 billion  at \\nDecember\\xa031, 2023 . The increase was primarily due to $3.5 \\nbillion of medium-term note issuances, partially offset by $2.1 \\nbillion of medium-term note repayments. As of March\\xa031, \\n2024 , there was $3.6 billion  of parent company debt \\nscheduled to mature in the remainder of 2024 . Future debt \\nmaturities may be met through medium-term note and capital \\nsecurity issuances and dividends from subsidiaries, as well \\nas from parent company cash and cash equivalents. \\nThe Company is subject to a regulatory Liquidity \\nCoverage Ratio (“LCR”) requirement which requires large \\nbanking organizations to maintain an adequate level of \\nunencumbered high quality liquid assets to meet estimated \\nliquidity needs over a 30-day stressed period. For the three \\nmonths ended March\\xa031, 2024  and December\\xa031, 2023 , the \\nCompany’s average daily LCR was 109.4 percent and 109.2 \\npercent, respectively. The Company was compliant with this \\nrequirement for both of these periods. \\nThe Company is also subject to a regulatory Net Stable \\nFunding Ratio (“NSFR”) requirement which requires large \\nbanking organizations to maintain a minimum level of stable \\nfunding based on the liquidity characteristics of their assets, \\ncommitments, and derivative exposures over a one-year time \\nhorizon. The Company was compliant with this requirement at \\nMarch\\xa031, 2024  and December\\xa031, 2023 . \\nRefer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — \\nLiquidity Risk Management” in the Company’s Annual Report \\non Form 10-K for the year ended December\\xa031, 2023 , for \\nfurther discussion on liquidity risk management. \\nEuropean Exposures  The Company provides merchant \\nprocessing and corporate trust services in Europe either \\ndirectly or through banking affiliations in Europe. Revenue \\ngenerated from sources in Europe represented \\napproximately 2 percent  of the Company’s total net revenue \\nfor the three  months ended March\\xa031, 2024 . Operating cash \\nfor these businesses is deposited on a short-term basis \\ntypically with certain European central banks. For deposits \\nplaced at other European banks, exposure is mitigated by \\nthe Company placing deposits at multiple banks and \\nmanaging the amounts on deposit at any bank based on \\ninstitution-specific deposit limits.

       " Document(page_content='Company had an aggregate amount on deposit with \\nEuropean banks of approximately $6.8 billion , predominately \\nwith the Central Bank of Ireland and Bank of England. \\nIn addition, the Company provides financing to domestic \\nmultinational corporations that generate revenue from \\ncustomers in European countries, transacts with various \\nEuropean banks as counterparties to certain derivative-\\nrelated activities, and through a subsidiary, manages money \\nmarket funds that hold certain investments in European \\nsovereign debt. Any deterioration in economic conditions in \\nEurope, including the impacts resulting from the Russia-\\nUkraine conflict, is not expected to have a significant effect \\non the Company related to these activities. \\nCommitments, Contingent Liabilities and Other \\nContractual Obligations  The Company participates in many \\ndifferent contractual arrangements which may or may not be \\nrecorded on its balance sheet, with unrelated or consolidated \\nentities, under which the Company has an obligation to pay \\ncertain amounts, provide credit or liquidity enhancements or \\nprovide market risk support. These arrangements include \\ncommitments to extend credit, letters of credit and various \\nforms of guarantees. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to \\nConsolidated Financial Statements for further information on \\nguarantees and contingent liabilities. These arrangements \\nalso include any obligation related to a variable interest held \\nin an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, \\ncredit enhancement or market risk support. Refer to Note 5 of \\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further \\ninformation related to the Company’s interests in variable \\ninterest entities. \\nCapital Management  The Company is committed to \\nmanaging capital to maintain strong protection for depositors \\nand creditors and for maximum shareholder benefit. The \\nCompany also manages its capital to exceed regulatory \\ncapital requirements for banking organizations. To achieve its \\ncapital goals, the Company employs a variety of capital \\nmanagement tools, including dividends, common share \\nrepurchases, and the issuance of subordinated debt, non-\\ncumulative perpetual preferred stock, common stock and \\nother capital instruments. The regulatory capital requirements \\neffective for the Company follow Basel III, with the Company \\nbeing subject to calculating its capital adequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted assets under the standardized \\napproach. Beginning in 2022, the Company began to phase \\ninto its regulatory capital requirements the cumulative \\ndeferred impact of its 2020 adoption of the accounting \\nguidance related to the impairment of financial instruments \\nbased on the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) \\nmethodology plus 25 percent of its quarterly credit reserve \\nincreases during 2020 and 2021. This cumulative deferred \\nimpact will continue to be phased into the Company’s \\nregulatory capital during 2024, culminating with a fully \\nphased in regulatory capital calculation beginning in 2025. \\nTable 10 provides a summary of statutory regulatory capital \\nratios in effect for the Company at March\\xa031, 2024  and \\nDecember\\xa031, 2023 . All regulatory ratios exceeded \\nregulatory “well-capitalized” requirements. \\nIn July 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory authorities \\nproposed a rule implementing the Basel Committee’s \\nfinalization of the post-crisis regulatory capital reforms. The \\nproposal provides for a July 1, 2025 effective date, subject to \\na three-year transition period. The proposal includes the \\nFundamental Review of the Trading Book, which replaces the \\nmarket risk rule, and introduces new standardized \\napproaches for credit risk, operational risk and credit \\nvaluation adjustment (CVA) risk, which would replace the \\ncurrent models-based approaches. The Company is \\ncurrently evaluating the impact of the proposed rule and \\nexpects that any final rule would result in the Company being \\nrequired to maintain increased levels of regulatory capital. \\nThe Company believes certain other capital ratios are \\nuseful in evaluating its capital adequacy. The Company’s \\ntangible common equity, as a percent of tangible assets and \\nas a percent of risk-weighted assets determined in \\naccordance with transitional regulatory capital requirements \\nrelated to the CECL methodology under the standardized \\napproach, was 5.2 percent  and 7.8 percent , respectively, at \\nMarch\\xa031, 2024 , compared with 5.3 percent  and 7.7 percent , \\nrespectively, at December\\xa031, 2023 . In addition, the \\nCompany’s common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted \\nassets ratio, reflecting the full implementation of the CECL \\nmethodology was 9.9 percent  at March\\xa031, 2024 , compared \\nwith 9.7 percent  at December\\xa031, 2023 .

Additionally, presentation of these measures \\nallows investors, analysts and banking regulators to assess \\nthe Company’s capital position relative to other financial \\nservices companies. These capital measures are not defined \\nin generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), or are \\nnot currently effective or defined in banking regulations. In \\naddition, certain of these measures differ from currently \\neffective capital ratios defined by banking regulations \\nprincipally in that the currently effective ratios, which are subject to certain transitional provisions, temporarily exclude \\nthe impact of the 2020 adoption of accounting guidance \\nrelated to impairment of financial instruments based on the \\nCECL methodology. As a result, these capital measures \\ndisclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP \\nfinancial measures. Management believes this information \\nhelps investors assess trends in the Company’s capital \\nadequacy. \\nThe Company also discloses net interest income and \\nrelated ratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, \\nwhich may also be considered non-GAAP financial \\nmeasures. The Company believes this presentation to be the \\npreferred industry measurement of net interest income as it \\nprovides a relevant comparison of net interest income arising \\nfrom taxable and tax-exempt sources. In addition, certain \\nperformance measures, including the efficiency ratio and net \\ninterest margin utilize net interest income on a taxable-\\nequivalent basis. \\nThere may be limits in the usefulness of these measures \\nto investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to \\nconsider the consolidated financial statements and other \\nfinancial information contained in this report in their entirety, \\nand not to rely on any single financial measure. \\nThe following tables show the Company’s calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures: \\n(Dollars in Millions)March 31,\\n2024December 31,\\n2023\\nTotal equity $ 56,033 $ 55,771 \\nPreferred stock  (6,808)  (6,808) \\nNoncontrolling interests  (465)  (465) \\nGoodwill (net of deferred tax liability)(a) (11,459)  (11,480) \\nIntangible assets (net of deferred tax liability), other than mortgage servicing rights  (2,158)  (2,278) \\nTangible common equity(1) 35,143  34,740 \\nCommon equity tier 1 capital, determined in accordance with transitional regulatory capital requirements \\nrelated to the CECL methodology implementation  45,239  44,947 \\nAdjustments(b) (433)  (866) \\nCommon equity tier 1 capital, reflecting the full implementation of the CECL methodology(2) 44,806  44,081 \\nTotal assets  683,606  663,491 \\nGoodwill (net of deferred tax liability)(a) (11,459)  (11,480) \\nIntangible assets (net of deferred tax liability), other than mortgage servicing rights  (2,158)  (2,278) \\nTangible assets(3) 669,989  649,733 \\nRisk-weighted assets, determined in accordance with prescribed regulatory capital requirements effective for \\nthe Company(4)  452,831  453,390 \\nAdjustments(c) (368)  (736) \\nRisk-weighted assets, reflecting the full implementation of the CECL methodology(5) 452,463  452,654 \\nRatios\\nTangible common equity to tangible assets(1)/(3) 5.2 %  5.3 %\\nTangible common equity to risk-weighted assets(1)/(4) 7.8  7.7 \\nCommon equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, reflecting the full implementation of the CECL \\nmethodology(2)/(5)  9.9  9.7 \\n(a) Includes goodwill related to certain investments in unconsolidated financial institutions per prescribed regulatory requirements. \\n(b) Includes the estimated increase in the allowance for credit losses related to the adoption of the CECL methodology net of deferred taxes. \\n(c) Includes the impact of the estimated increase in the allowance for credit losses related to the adoption of the CECL methodology. \\nU.S. Bancorp 27', metadata={'source': './reports/24Q1USBANK\\\\Q1-2024-Form-10-Q.pdf', 'page': 27}),\n",

The preparation of financial statements in \\nconformity with GAAP requires management to make \\nestimates and assumptions. The Company’s financial \\nposition and results of operations can be affected by these \\nestimates and assumptions, which are integral to \\nunderstanding the Company’s financial statements. Critical \\naccounting policies are those policies management believes \\nare the most important to the portrayal of the Company’s \\nfinancial condition and results, and require management to \\nmake estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most \\naccounting policies are not considered by management to \\nbe critical accounting policies. Management has discussed \\nthe development and the selection of critical accounting \\npolicies with the Company’s Audit Committee. Those policies \\nconsidered to be critical accounting policies relate to the \\nallowance for credit losses, fair value estimates, MSRs, and \\nincome taxes. These accounting policies are discussed in \\ndetail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Critical \\nAccounting Policies” and the Notes to Consolidated Financial \\nStatements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for \\nthe year ended December\\xa031, 2023 . Controls and Procedures \\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the \\nCompany’s management, including its principal executive \\nofficer and principal financial officer, the Company has \\nevaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its \\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules \\n13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act \\nof 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)). Based upon this evaluation, \\nthe principal executive officer and principal financial officer \\nhave concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by \\nthis report, the Company’s disclosure controls and \\nprocedures were effective. \\nDuring the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there \\nwas no change made in the Company’s internal control over \\nfinancial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and \\n15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially \\naffected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the \\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. \\n28 U.S. Bancorp', metadata={'source': './reports/24Q1USBANK\\\\Q1-2024-Form-10-Q.pdf', 'page': 28}),\n",

Under the guidance, a company can elect not to apply certain modification accounting requirements to contracts \\naffected by reference rate transition, if certain criteria are met. A company that makes this election would not be required to \\nremeasure the contracts at the modification date or reassess a previous accounting determination. This guidance also permits a \\ncompany to elect various optional expedients that would allow it to continue applying hedge accounting for hedging relationships \\naffected by reference rate transition, if certain criteria are met. The guidance is effective upon issuance and generally can be \\napplied through December 31, 2024. The Company is applying certain optional expedients and exceptions for cash flow hedges \\nand will continue to evaluate these for eligible contract modifications and hedging relationships.  \\nIncome Taxes - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures  In December 2023, the FASB issued guidance, effective for the \\nCompany for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, related to income tax disclosures. This guidance \\nrequires additional information in income tax rate reconciliation disclosures and additional disclosures about income taxes paid. \\nThe guidance is required, at a minimum, to be adopted on a prospective basis, with an option to apply it retrospectively. The \\nCompany expects the adoption of this guidance will not be material to its financial statements.\\nSegment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures  In November 2023, the FASB issued guidance, \\neffective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim reporting periods \\nbeginning after December 15, 2024, related to segment disclosures. This guidance requires disclosures of significant segment \\nexpenses and other segment items and expands interim period disclosure requirements to include segment profit or loss and \\nassets, which are currently only required to be disclosed annually. The guidance is required to be adopted retrospectively to all \\nperiods presented in the financial statements.

Purchased loans that have \\nexperienced more-than-insignificant deterioration from origination are considered purchased credit deteriorated loans. All other \\npurchased loans are considered non-purchased credit deteriorated loans. \\nAllowance for Credit Losses  The allowance for credit losses is established for current expected credit losses on the Company’s \\nloan and lease portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments. The allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives \\nof the applicable assets, inclusive of expected recoveries. The allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions \\ncharged to earnings and reduced by net charge-offs. Management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit \\nlosses on a quarterly basis. \\nMultiple economic scenarios are considered over a three-year  reasonable and supportable forecast period, which includes \\nincreasing consideration of historical loss experience over years two and three. These economic scenarios are constructed with \\ninterrelated projections of multiple economic variables, and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of \\nthose economic variables with credit losses. After the forecast period, the Company fully reverts to long-term historical loss \\nexperience, adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease portfolio, to estimate losses over the \\nremaining life of the portfolio. The economic scenarios are updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of \\nreasonable estimates, from better to worse than current expectations. Scenarios are weighted based on the Company’s \\nexpectation of economic conditions for the foreseeable future and reflect significant judgment and consideration of economic \\nforecast uncertainty. Final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios, due to the \\nunique aspects of current conditions and expectations. These factors may include, but are not limited to, loan servicing practices, \\nregulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and monetary policy actions. \\n38 U.S. Bancorp', metadata={'source': './reports/24Q1USBANK\\\\Q1-2024-Form-10-Q.pdf', 'page': 38}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forward-looking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors \\naffecting lifetime credit losses. These factors include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic variables such as unemployment \\nrates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, inflation, interest rates and corporate bonds spreads, as well as loan and \\nborrower characteristics, such as internal risk ratings on commercial loans and consumer credit scores, delinquency status, \\ncollateral type and available valuation information, consideration of end-of-term losses on lease residuals, and the remaining term \\nof the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments. For each loan portfolio, including those loans modified under various loan \\nmodification programs, model estimates are adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition, \\nlending policies, underwriting standards, risk management practices, economic conditions or other factors that would affect the \\naccuracy of the model. Expected credit loss estimates also include consideration of expected cash recoveries on loans previously \\ncharged-off or expected recoveries on collateral dependent loans where recovery is expected through sale of the collateral at fair \\nvalue less selling costs. Where loans do not exhibit similar risk characteristics, an individual analysis is performed to consider \\nexpected credit losses. The allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans greater than  $5 million  in the commercial lending \\nsegment is based on an analysis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate, the observable \\nmarket price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, for collateral-dependent loans as appropriate. For \\nsmaller commercial loans collectively evaluated for impairment, historical loss experience is also incorporated into the allowance \\nmethodology applied to this category of loans. \\nThe Company’s methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses also considers the imprecision \\ninherent in the methodologies used and allocated to the various loan portfolios. As a result, amounts determined under the \\nmethodologies described above are adjusted by management to consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not \\ncaptured in the quantitative model adjustments which include, but are not limited to, the following: model imprecision, imprecision \\nin economic scenario assumptions, and emerging risks related to either changes in the environment that are affecting specific \\nportfolios, or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model performance. The consideration of these items \\nresults in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the Company’s allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio. \\nThe Company also assesses the credit risk associated with off-balance sheet loan commitments, letters of credit, investment \\nsecurities and derivatives. Credit risk associated with derivatives is reflected in the fair values recorded for those positions. The \\nliability for off-balance sheet credit exposure related to loan commitments and other credit guarantees is included in other \\nliabilities. Because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as \\nfor loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments. \\nThe results of the analysis are evaluated quarterly to confirm the estimates are appropriate for each specific loan portfolio, as \\nwell as the entire loan portfolio, as the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio. \\nU.S. Bancorp 39', metadata={'source': './reports/24Q1USBANK\\\\Q1-2024-Form-10-Q.pdf', 'page': 39}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Credit Quality  The credit quality of the Company’s loan portfolios is assessed as a function of net credit losses, levels of \\nnonperforming assets and delinquencies, and credit quality ratings as defined by the Company. \\nFor all loan portfolio classes, loans are considered past due based on the number of days delinquent except for monthly \\namortizing loans which are classified delinquent based upon the number of contractually required payments not made (for \\nexample, two missed payments is considered 30 days delinquent). When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid accrued \\ninterest is reversed, reducing interest income in the current period. \\nCommercial lending segment loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when the collection of principal and interest \\nhas become 90 days  past due or is otherwise considered doubtful. Commercial lending segment loans are generally fully charged \\ndown if unsecured by collateral or partially charged down to the fair value of the collateral securing the loan, less costs to sell, \\nwhen the loan is placed on nonaccrual. \\nConsumer lending segment loans are generally charged-off at a specific number of days or payments past due. Residential \\nmortgages and other retail loans secured by 1-4 family properties are generally charged down to the fair value of the collateral \\nsecuring the loan, less costs to sell, at 180 days  past due. Residential mortgage loans and lines in a first lien position are placed \\non nonaccrual status in instances where a partial charge-off occurs unless the loan is well secured and in the process of \\ncollection. Residential mortgage loans and lines in a junior lien position secured by 1-4 family properties are placed on nonaccrual \\nstatus at 120 days  past due or when they are behind a first lien that has become 180 days  or greater past due or placed on \\nnonaccrual status. Any secured consumer lending segment loan whose borrower has had debt discharged through bankruptcy, \\nfor which the loan amount exceeds the fair value of the collateral, is charged down to the fair value of the related collateral and the \\nremaining balance is placed on nonaccrual status. Credit card loans continue to accrue interest until the account is charged-off. \\nCredit cards are charged-off at 180 days  past due. Other retail loans not secured by 1-4 family properties are charged-off at 120 \\ndays  past due, and revolving consumer lines are charged-off at 180 days  past due. Similar to credit cards, other retail loans are \\ngenerally not placed on nonaccrual status because of the relative short period of time to charge-off. Certain retail customers \\nhaving financial difficulties may have the terms of their credit card and other loan agreements modified to require only principal \\npayments and, as such, are reported as nonaccrual. \\nFor all loan classes, interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are generally recorded as a reduction to a loan’s carrying \\namount while a loan is on nonaccrual and are recognized as interest income upon payoff of the loan. However, interest income \\nmay be recognized for interest payments if the remaining carrying amount of the loan is believed to be collectible. In certain \\ncircumstances, loans in any class may be restored to accrual status, such as when a loan has demonstrated sustained repayment \\nperformance or no amounts are past due and prospects for future payment are no longer in doubt, or when the loan becomes well \\nsecured and is in the process of collection. Loans where there has been a partial charge-off may be returned to accrual status if \\nall principal and interest (including amounts previously charged-off) is expected to be collected and the loan is current. \\nThe following table provides a summary of loans by portfolio class, including the delinquency status of those that continue to \\naccrue interest, and those that are nonperforming:\\nAccruing\\n(Dollars in Millions) Current30-89 Days \\nPast Due90 Days or \\nMore Past Due Nonperforming(b)Total\\nMarch 31, 2024\\nCommercial $ 133,763 $ 309 $ 105 $ 549 $ 134,726 \\nCommercial real estate  51,753  22  2  900  52,677 \\nResidential mortgages(a) 115,636  143  145  155  116,079 \\nCredit card  27,058  390  396  —  27,844 \\nOther retail  42,823  236  66  137  43,262 \\nTotal loans $ 371,033 $ 1,100 $ 714 $ 1,741 $ 374,588 \\nDecember 31, 2023\\nCommercial $ 130,925 $ 464 $ 116 $ 376 $ 131,881 \\nCommercial real estate  52,619  55  4  777  53,455 \\nResidential mortgages(a) 115,067  169  136  158  115,530 \\nCredit card  27,779  406  375  —  28,560 \\nOther retail  43,926  278  67  138  44,409 \\nTotal loans $ 370,316 $ 1,372 $ 698 $ 1,449 $ 373,835 \\n(a) At March\\xa031, 2024 , $491\\xa0million  of loans 30–89 days past due and $1.8\\xa0billion  of loans 90 days or more past due purchased and that could be purchased from GNMA mortgage \\npools under delinquent loan repurchase options whose repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans \\nAffairs, were classified as current, compared with $595\\xa0million  and $2.0\\xa0billion  at December\\xa031, 2023 , respectively.  \\n(b) Substantially all nonperforming loans at March\\xa031, 2024  and December\\xa031, 2023 , had an associated allowance for credit losses.

These modifications may include adjustments to interest rates, \\nconversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates, extension of maturity dates or deferrals of payments, capitalization of accrued \\ninterest and/or outstanding advances, or in limited situations, partial forgiveness of loan principal. In most instances, participation \\nin residential mortgage loan modification programs requires the customer to complete a short-term trial period. A permanent loan \\nmodification is contingent on the customer successfully completing the trial period arrangement, and the loan documents are not \\nmodified until that time. \\nCredit card and other retail loan modifications are generally part of distinct modification programs providing customers \\nexperiencing financial difficulty with modifications whereby balances may be amortized up to 60 months , and generally include \\nwaiver of fees and reduced interest rates. \\nLoans that receive a forbearance plan generally remain in default until they are no longer delinquent as the result of the \\npayment of all past due amounts or the borrower receiving a term extension or modification.

       " Document(page_content='N O T E \\u2009 5Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Variable \\nInterest Entities\\nThe Company transfers financial assets in the normal course of business. The majority of the Company’s financial asset transfers \\nare residential mortgage loan sales primarily to GSEs, transfers of tax-advantaged investments, commercial loan sales through \\nparticipation agreements, and other individual or portfolio loan and securities sales. In accordance with the accounting guidance \\nfor asset transfers, the Company considers any ongoing involvement with transferred assets in determining whether the assets \\ncan be derecognized from the balance sheet. Guarantees provided to certain third parties in connection with the transfer of assets \\nare further discussed in Note 15.\\nFor loans sold under participation agreements, the Company also considers whether the terms of the loan participation \\nagreement meet the accounting definition of a participating interest. With the exception of servicing and certain performance-\\nbased guarantees, the Company’s continuing involvement with financial assets sold is minimal and generally limited to market \\ncustomary representation and warranty clauses. Any gain or loss on sale depends on the previous carrying amount of the \\ntransferred financial assets, the consideration received, and any liabilities incurred in exchange for the transferred assets. Upon \\ntransfer, any servicing assets and other interests that continue to be held by the Company are initially recognized at fair value.  For \\nfurther information on MSRs, refer to Note 6. On a limited basis, the Company may acquire and package high-grade corporate \\nbonds for select corporate customers, in which the Company generally has no continuing involvement with these transactions. \\nAdditionally, the Company is an authorized GNMA issuer and issues GNMA securities on a regular basis. The Company has no \\nother asset securitizations or similar asset-backed financing arrangements that are off-balance sheet.  \\nThe Company is involved in various entities that are considered to be variable interest entities (“VIEs”). The Company’s \\ninvestments in VIEs are primarily related to investments promoting affordable housing, community development and renewable \\nenergy sources. Some of these tax-advantaged investments support the Company’s regulatory compliance with the Community \\nReinvestment Act. The Company’s investments in these entities generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and \\nstate income tax credits, and other tax benefits, such as tax deductions from operating losses of the investments, over specified \\ntime periods. These tax credits are recognized as a reduction of tax expense or, for investments qualifying as investment tax \\ncredits, as a reduction to the related investment asset. The Company recognized federal and state income tax credits related to its \\naffordable housing and other tax-advantaged investments in tax expense of $139\\xa0million  and $138\\xa0million  for the three months \\nended March 31, 2024  and 2023 , respectively. The Company also recognized $63\\xa0million  and $164\\xa0million  of investment tax \\ncredits for the three months ended March 31, 2024  and 2023 , respectively. The Company recognized $138\\xa0million  and \\n$130\\xa0million  of expenses related to all of these investments for the three months ended March 31, 2024  and 2023 , respectively, \\nwhich were primarily included in tax expense. \\nThe Company is not required to consolidate VIEs in which it has concluded it does not have a controlling financial interest, and \\nthus is not the primary beneficiary. In such cases, the Company does not have both the power to direct the entities’ most \\nsignificant activities and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the \\nVIEs. \\nThe Company’s investments in these unconsolidated VIEs are carried in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The \\nCompany’s unfunded capital and other commitments related to these unconsolidated VIEs are generally carried in other liabilities \\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss from these unconsolidated VIEs include the \\ninvestment recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, net of unfunded capital commitments, and previously \\nrecorded tax credits which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at \\nthe project level. While the Company believes potential losses from these investments are remote, the maximum exposure was \\ndetermined by assuming a scenario where the community-based business and housing projects completely fail and do not meet \\ncertain government compliance requirements resulting in recapture of the related tax credits. \\nThe following table provides a summary of investments in community development and tax-advantaged VIEs that the Company \\nhas not consolidated: \\n(Dollars in Millions) March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\\nInvestment carrying amount $ 7,259 $ 6,659 \\nUnfunded capital and other commitments  4,104  3,619 \\nMaximum exposure to loss  8,959  9,002 \\nThe Company also has noncontrolling financial investments in private investment funds and partnerships considered to be \\nVIEs, which are not consolidated.

These amounts compared to $6.1\\xa0billion  and $4.4\\xa0billion , respectively, at December\\xa031, 2023 . The majority of the assets \\nof these consolidated VIEs are reported in other assets, and the liabilities are reported in long-term debt and other liabilities.

The Company’s exposure to the consolidated VIEs is generally limited to the carrying value of \\nits variable interests plus any related tax credits previously recognized or transferred to others with a guarantee. \\nIn addition, the Company sponsors a municipal bond securities tender option bond program. The Company controls the \\nactivities of the program’s entities, is entitled to the residual returns and provides liquidity and remarketing arrangements to the \\nprogram.

The Company recognizes all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair \\nvalue in other assets or in other liabilities. On the date the Company enters into a derivative contract, the derivative is designated \\nas either a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, net investment hedge, or a designation is not made as it is a customer-related \\ntransaction, an economic hedge for asset/liability risk management purposes or another stand-alone derivative created through \\nthe Company’s operations (“free-standing derivative”). When a derivative is designated as a fair value, cash flow or net investment \\nhedge, the Company performs an assessment, at inception and, at a minimum, quarterly thereafter, to determine the effectiveness \\nof the derivative in offsetting changes in the value or cash flows of the hedged item(s). \\nFair Value Hedges  These derivatives are interest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge the change in fair value related to \\ninterest rate changes of its underlying available-for-sale investment securities and fixed-rate debt. Changes in the fair value of \\nderivatives designated as fair value hedges, and changes in the fair value of the hedged items, are recorded in earnings. \\nCash Flow Hedges  These derivatives are interest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge the forecasted cash flows from its \\nunderlying variable-rate loans and debt. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in \\nother comprehensive income (loss) until the cash flows of the hedged items are realized. If a derivative designated as a cash flow \\nhedge is terminated or ceases to be highly effective, the gain or loss in other comprehensive income (loss) is amortized to \\nearnings over the period the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings. If a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer \\nprobable, hedge accounting is ceased and any gain or loss included in other comprehensive income (loss) is reported in earnings \\nimmediately, unless the forecasted transaction is at least reasonably possible of occurring, whereby the amounts remain within \\nother comprehensive income (loss). At March\\xa031, 2024 , the Company had $461\\xa0million  (net-of-tax) of realized and unrealized \\nlosses on derivatives classified as cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), compared with $242\\xa0million  \\n(net-of-tax) of realized and unrealized losses at December\\xa031, 2023 . The estimated amount to be reclassified from other \\ncomprehensive income (loss) into earnings during the next 12 months is a loss of $172\\xa0million  (net-of-tax). All cash flow hedges \\nwere highly effective for the three months ended March 31, 2024 . \\nNet Investment Hedges  The Company uses forward commitments to sell specified amounts of certain foreign currencies, and \\nnon-derivative debt instruments, to hedge the volatility of its net investment in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign \\ncurrency exchange rates. The carrying amount of non-derivative debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was \\n$1.3\\xa0billion  at March\\xa031, 2024  and December\\xa031, 2023 . \\nOther Derivative Positions  The Company enters into free-standing derivatives to mitigate interest rate risk and for other risk \\nmanagement purposes. These derivatives include forward commitments to sell TBAs and other commitments to sell residential \\nmortgage loans, which are used to economically hedge the interest rate risk related to MLHFS and unfunded mortgage loan \\ncommitments. The Company also enters into interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward commitments to buy TBAs, U.S. Treasury and \\nEurodollar futures and options on U.S. Treasury futures to economically hedge the change in the fair value of the Company’s \\nMSRs. The Company enters into foreign currency forwards to economically hedge remeasurement gains and losses the Company \\n52 U.S. Bancorp', metadata={'source': './reports/24Q1USBANK\\\\Q1-2024-Form-10-Q.pdf', 'page': 52}),\n",

The Company also enters into interest rate swaps as economic \\nhedges of fair value option elected deposits. In addition, the Company acts as a seller and buyer of interest rate, foreign \\nexchange and commodity contracts for its customers. The Company mitigates the market and liquidity risk associated with these \\ncustomer derivatives by entering into similar offsetting positions with broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis by entering into other \\nderivative or non-derivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure to earnings from these customer-related \\npositions. The Company’s customer derivatives and related hedges are monitored and reviewed by the Company’s Market Risk \\nCommittee, which establishes policies for market risk management, including exposure limits for each portfolio.

The Company measures that \\ncredit risk using a credit valuation adjustment and includes it within the fair value of the derivative. The Company manages \\ncounterparty credit risk through diversification of its derivative positions among various counterparties, by entering into derivative \\npositions that are centrally cleared through clearinghouses, by entering into master netting arrangements and, where possible, by \\nrequiring collateral arrangements. A master netting arrangement allows two counterparties, who have multiple derivative contracts \\nwith each other, the ability to net settle amounts under all contracts, including any related collateral, through a single payment and \\nin a single currency. Collateral arrangements generally require the counterparty to deliver collateral (typically cash or U.S. \\nTreasury and agency securities) equal to the Company’s net derivative receivable, subject to minimum transfer and credit rating \\nrequirements. \\nThe Company’s collateral arrangements are predominately bilateral and, therefore, contain provisions that require \\ncollateralization of the Company’s net liability derivative positions. Required collateral coverage is based on net liability thresholds \\nand may be contingent upon the Company’s credit rating from two of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. If \\nthe Company’s credit rating were to fall below credit ratings thresholds established in the collateral arrangements, the \\ncounterparties to the derivatives could request immediate additional collateral coverage up to and including full collateral \\ncoverage for derivatives in a net liability position. The aggregate fair value of all derivatives under collateral arrangements that \\nwere in a net liability position at March\\xa031, 2024 , was $2.6\\xa0billion . At March\\xa031, 2024 , the Company had $2.3\\xa0billion  of cash posted \\nas collateral against this net liability position. \\nNOTE 13 Netting Arrangements for Certain Financial Instruments and Securities\\nFinancing Activities\\nThe Company’s derivative portfolio consists of bilateral over-the-counter trades, certain interest rate derivatives and credit \\ncontracts required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses per current regulations, and exchange-traded positions which \\nmay include U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures or options on U.S. Treasury futures.

Collateral is typically cash, but securities may be allowed under collateral arrangements with certain \\ncounterparties. Receivables and payables related to cash collateral are included in other assets and other liabilities on the \\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, along with the related derivative asset and liability fair values. Any securities pledged to \\ncounterparties as collateral remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities received from counterparties as collateral are \\nnot recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, unless the counterparty defaults.

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase include repurchase agreements and securities \\nloaned transactions. Securities purchased under agreements to resell include reverse repurchase agreements and securities \\nborrowed transactions.

Derivatives, trading and available-for-sale investment securities, MSRs, certain time \\ndeposits and substantially all MLHFS are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Company \\nmay be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as loans held for sale, loans held for investment \\nand certain other assets. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower-of-cost-or-fair value \\naccounting or impairment write-downs of individual assets. Other financial instruments, such as held-to-maturity investment \\nsecurities, loans, the majority of time deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt, are accounted for at amortized cost. \\nSee “Fair Value of Financial Instruments” in this Note for further information on the estimated fair value of these other financial \\ninstruments. In accordance with disclosure guidance, certain financial instruments, such as deposits with no defined or \\ncontractual maturity, receivables and payables due in one year or less, insurance contracts and equity investments not accounted \\nfor at fair value, are excluded from this Note. \\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in \\nthe principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the \\nmeasurement date. A fair value measurement reflects all of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the \\nasset or liability, including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the \\nsale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance. \\nThe Company groups its assets and liabilities measured at fair value into a three-level hierarchy for valuation techniques used \\nto measure financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. This hierarchy is based on whether the valuation inputs are \\nobservable or unobservable. These levels are: \\n•Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 includes U.S. Treasury securities, as well \\nas exchange-traded instruments. \\n•Level 2 — Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices \\nin markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for \\nsubstantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 includes debt securities that are traded less frequently than \\nexchange-traded instruments and which are typically valued using third party pricing services; derivative contracts and \\nother assets and liabilities, including securities, and certain time deposits, whose value is determined using a pricing model \\nwith inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data; \\nand MLHFS whose values are determined using quoted prices for similar assets or pricing models with inputs that are \\nobservable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data. \\n•Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of \\nthe assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing \\nmodels, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair \\nvalue requires significant management judgment or estimation. This category includes MSRs and certain derivative \\ncontracts. \\nValuation Methodologies \\nThe valuation methodologies used by the Company to measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value are described below. In \\naddition, the following section includes an indication of the level of the fair value hierarchy in which the assets or liabilities are \\nclassified. Where appropriate, the descriptions include information about the valuation models and key inputs to those models. \\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024  and 2023 , there were no significant changes to the valuation techniques used by \\nthe Company to measure fair value. \\nAvailable-for-Sale Investment Securities  When quoted market prices for identical securities are available in an active market, \\nthese prices are used to determine fair value and these securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 \\ninvestment securities include U.S. Treasury and exchange-traded securities. \\nFor other securities, quoted market prices may not be readily available for the specific securities. When possible, the Company \\ndetermines fair value based on market observable information, including quoted market prices for similar securities, inactive \\ntransaction prices, and broker quotes. These securities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 2 valuations \\nare generally provided by a third-party pricing service. Level 2 investment securities are predominantly agency mortgage-backed \\nsecurities, certain other asset-backed securities, obligations of state and political subdivisions and agency debt securities. \\nMortgage Loans Held For Sale  MLHFS measured at fair value, for which an active secondary market and readily available \\nmarket prices exist, are initially valued at the transaction price and are subsequently valued by comparison to instruments with \\nsimilar collateral and risk profiles. MLHFS are classified within Level 2. Included in mortgage banking revenue were net losses of \\n$1\\xa0million  and $3\\xa0million  for the three months ended March 31, 2024  and 2023 , respectively, from the changes to fair value of \\nthese MLHFS under fair value option accounting guidance. Changes in fair value due to instrument specific credit risk were \\nimmaterial. Interest income for MLHFS is measured based on contractual interest rates and reported as interest income on the \\nConsolidated Statement of Income. Electing to measure MLHFS at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better \\nU.S. Bancorp 59', metadata={'source': './reports/24Q1USBANK\\\\Q1-2024-Form-10-Q.pdf', 'page': 59}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='matches changes in fair value of these assets with changes in the value of the derivative instruments used to economically hedge \\nthem without the burden of complying with the requirements for hedge accounting. \\nTime Deposits  The Company elects the fair value option to account for certain time deposits that are hedged with derivatives that \\ndo not qualify for hedge accounting. Electing to measure these time deposits at fair value reduces certain timing differences and \\nbetter matches changes in fair value of these deposits with changes in the value of the derivative instruments used to \\neconomically hedge them. The time deposits measured at fair value are valued using a discounted cash flow model that utilizes \\nmarket observable inputs and are classified within Level 2. Included in interest expense on deposits were net gains of $8\\xa0million  \\nfor the three months ended March\\xa031, 2024  from the changes in fair value of time deposits under fair value option accounting \\nguidance. \\nMortgage Servicing Rights  MSRs are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology, and are classified within Level 3. The \\nCompany determines fair value of the MSRs by projecting future cash flows for different interest rate scenarios using prepayment \\nrates and other assumptions, and discounts these cash flows using a risk adjusted rate based on option adjusted spread levels. \\nThere is minimal observable market activity for MSRs on comparable portfolios and, therefore, the determination of fair value \\nrequires significant management judgment. Refer to Note 6 for further information on MSR valuation assumptions. \\nDerivatives  The majority of derivatives held by the Company are executed over-the-counter or centrally cleared through \\nclearinghouses and are valued using market standard cash flow valuation techniques. The models incorporate inputs, depending \\non the type of derivative, including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates and volatility. All derivative values incorporate an \\nassessment of the risk of counterparty nonperformance, measured based on the Company’s evaluation of credit risk including \\nexternal assessments of credit risk. The Company monitors and manages its nonperformance risk by considering its ability to net \\nderivative positions under master netting arrangements, as well as collateral received or provided under collateral arrangements. \\nAccordingly, the Company has elected to measure the fair value of derivatives, at a counterparty level, on a net basis. The \\nmajority of the derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, as the significant inputs to the models, including \\nnonperformance risk, are observable. However, certain derivative transactions are with counterparties where risk of \\nnonperformance cannot be observed in the market and, therefore, the credit valuation adjustments result in these derivatives \\nbeing classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. \\nThe Company also has other derivative contracts that are created through its operations, including commitments to purchase \\nand originate mortgage loans and swap agreements executed in conjunction with the sale of a portion of its Class B common and \\npreferred shares of Visa Inc. (the “Visa swaps”). The mortgage loan commitments are valued by pricing models that include \\nmarket observable and unobservable inputs, which result in the commitments being classified within Level 3 of the fair value \\nhierarchy. The unobservable inputs include assumptions about the percentage of commitments that actually become a closed \\nloan and the MSR value that is inherent in the underlying loan value. The Visa swaps require payments by either the Company or \\nthe purchaser of the Visa Inc. Class B common and preferred shares when there are changes in the conversion rate of the Visa \\nInc. Class B common and preferred shares to Visa Inc. Class A common and preferred shares, respectively, as well as quarterly \\npayments to the purchaser based on specified terms of the agreements. Management reviews and updates the Visa swaps fair \\nvalue in conjunction with its review of Visa Inc. related litigation contingencies, and the associated escrow funding. The expected \\nlitigation resolution impacts the Visa Inc. Class B common share to Visa Inc. Class A common share conversion rate, as well as \\nthe ultimate termination date for the Visa swaps. Accordingly, the Visa swaps are classified within Level 3. Refer to Note 15 for \\nfurther information on the Visa Inc. restructuring and related card association litigation. \\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities \\nThe following section provides information to facilitate an understanding of the uncertainty in the fair value measurements for the \\nCompany’s Level 3 assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This section includes a \\ndescription of the significant inputs used by the Company and a description of any interrelationships between these inputs. The \\ndiscussion below excludes nonrecurring fair value measurements of collateral value used for impairment measures for loans and \\nOREO. These valuations utilize third party appraisal or broker price opinions, and are classified as Level 3 due to the significant \\njudgment involved. \\nMortgage Servicing Rights  The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s MSRs are \\nexpected prepayments and the option adjusted spread that is added to the risk-free rate to discount projected cash flows. \\nSignificant increases in either of these inputs in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value measurement. \\nSignificant decreases in either of these inputs in isolation would have resulted in a significantly higher fair value measurement. \\nThere is no direct interrelationship between prepayments and option adjusted spread. Prepayment rates generally move in the \\nopposite direction of market interest rates. Option adjusted spread is generally impacted by changes in market return \\nrequirements. \\n60 U.S. Bancorp', metadata={'source': './reports/24Q1USBANK\\\\Q1-2024-Form-10-Q.pdf', 'page': 60}),\n",

A significant decrease in the credit \\nvaluation adjustment would have resulted in a higher fair value measurement.

Inc. card association or its affiliates (collectively “Visa”). In \\n2007, Visa completed a restructuring and issued shares of Visa Inc. common stock to its financial institution members in \\ncontemplation of its initial public offering (“IPO”) completed in the first quarter of 2008 (the “Visa Reorganization”). As a part of the \\nVisa Reorganization, the Company received its proportionate number of shares of Visa Inc. common stock, which were \\nsubsequently converted to Class B shares of Visa Inc. (“Class B shares”). As of March\\xa031, 2024 , the Company has sold \\nsubstantially all of its Class B shares.\\nVisa U.S.A. Inc. (“Visa U.S.A.”) and MasterCard International (collectively, the “Card Brands”) are defendants in antitrust \\nlawsuits challenging the practices of the Card Brands (the “Visa Litigation”). Visa U.S.A. member banks have a contingent \\nobligation to indemnify Visa Inc. under the Visa U.S.A. bylaws (which were modified at the time of the restructuring in October \\n2007) for potential losses arising from the Visa Litigation. The indemnification by the Visa U.S.A. member banks has no specific \\nmaximum amount. Using proceeds from its IPO and through reductions to the conversion ratio applicable to the Class B shares \\nheld by Visa U.S.A. member banks, Visa Inc. has funded an escrow account for the benefit of member financial institutions to fund \\ntheir indemnification obligations associated with the Visa Litigation. The receivable related to the escrow account is classified in \\nother liabilities and fully offsets the related Visa Litigation contingent liability. \\nIn October 2012, Visa signed a settlement agreement to resolve merchant class action claims associated with the multidistrict \\ninterchange litigation pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the “Multi-District Litigation”). \\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the approval of that settlement and remanded the matter to the district \\ncourt. Thereafter, the case was split into two putative class actions, one seeking damages (the “Damages Action”) and a separate \\nclass action seeking injunctive relief only (the “Injunctive Action”). The Damages Action was settled and is fully resolved. A \\nnumber of merchants opted out of the Damages Action class settlement and filed individual cases in various federal district \\ncourts. Some of those cases have been settled and others are still being litigated. In March 2024, Visa signed a settlement \\nagreement to resolve the Injunctive Action. The proposed settlement, which provides lower interchange rates and various other \\nrules changes for U.S. merchants, requires court approval.\\nOther Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities  \\nThe following table is a summary of other guarantees and contingent liabilities of the Company at March\\xa031, 2024 : \\n(Dollars in Millions)Collateral  \\nHeldCarrying  \\nAmountMaximum \\nPotential \\nFuture \\nPayments\\nStandby letters of credit $ — $ 21 $ 11,114 \\nSecurities lending indemnifications  9,173  —  8,985 \\nAsset sales  —  99  9,881 \\u2009 ( a )  \\nMerchant processing  802  64  140,347 \\nTender option bond program guarantee  476  —  466 \\nOther  —  21  2,935 \\n(a) The maximum potential future payments do not include loan sales where the Company provides standard representation and warranties to the buyer against losses related to loan \\nunderwriting documentation defects that may have existed at the time of sale that generally are identified after the occurrence of a triggering event such as delinquency. For these \\ntypes of loan sales, the maximum potential future payments is generally the unpaid principal balance of loans sold measured at the end of the current reporting period. Actual \\nlosses will be significantly less than the maximum exposure, as only a fraction of loans sold will have a representation and warranty breach, and any losses on repurchase would \\ngenerally be mitigated by any collateral held against the loans. \\nMerchant Processing  The Company, through its subsidiaries, provides merchant processing services. Under the rules of credit \\ncard associations, a merchant processor retains a contingent liability for credit card transactions processed. This contingent \\nliability arises in the event of a billing dispute between the merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the \\ncardholder’s favor. In this situation, the transaction is “charged-back” to the merchant and the disputed amount is credited or \\notherwise refunded to the cardholder. If the Company is unable to collect this amount from the merchant, it bears the loss for the \\namount of the refund paid to the cardholder. \\nThe Company currently processes card transactions in the United States, Canada and Europe through wholly-owned \\nsubsidiaries. In the event a merchant was unable to fulfill product or services subject to future delivery, such as airline tickets, the \\nCompany could become financially liable for refunding the purchase price of such products or services purchased through the \\ncredit card associations under the charge-back provisions. Charge-back risk related to these merchants is evaluated in a manner \\nsimilar to credit risk assessments and, as such, merchant processing contracts contain various provisions to protect the Company \\nin the event of default. At March\\xa031, 2024 , the value of airline tickets purchased to be delivered at a future date through card \\ntransactions processed by the Company was $12.9\\xa0billion . The Company held collateral of $682\\xa0million  in escrow deposits, letters \\nof credit and indemnities from financial institutions, and liens on various assets. In addition to specific collateral or other credit \\nenhancements, the Company maintains a liability for its implied guarantees associated with future delivery. At March\\xa031, 2024 , the \\nliability was $40\\xa0million  primarily related to these airline processing arrangements. \\nU.S. Bancorp 65', metadata={'source': './reports/24Q1USBANK\\\\Q1-2024-Form-10-Q.pdf', 'page': 65}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Asset Sales  The Company regularly sells loans to GSEs as part of its mortgage banking activities. The Company provides \\ncustomary representations and warranties to GSEs in conjunction with these sales. These representations and warranties \\ngenerally require the Company to repurchase assets if it is subsequently determined that a loan did not meet specified criteria, \\nsuch as a documentation deficiency or rescission of mortgage insurance. If the Company is unable to cure or refute a repurchase \\nrequest, the Company is generally obligated to repurchase the loan or otherwise reimburse the GSE for losses. At March\\xa031, 2024 , \\nthe Company had reserved $12\\xa0million  for potential losses from representation and warranty obligations, compared with $13 \\nmillion  at December\\xa031, 2023 . The Company’s reserve reflects management’s best estimate of losses for representation and \\nwarranty obligations. The Company’s repurchase reserve is modeled at the loan level, taking into consideration the individual \\ncredit quality and borrower activity that has transpired since origination. The model applies credit quality and economic risk \\nfactors to derive a probability of default and potential repurchase that are based on the Company’s historical loss experience, and \\nestimates loss severity based on expected collateral value. The Company also considers qualitative factors that may result in \\nanticipated losses differing from historical loss trends. \\nAs of March\\xa031, 2024  and December\\xa031, 2023 , the Company had $11\\xa0million  and $18 million , respectively, of unresolved \\nrepresentation and warranty claims from GSEs. The Company does not have a significant amount of unresolved claims from \\ninvestors other than GSEs. \\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters  \\nThe Company is subject to various litigation and regulatory matters that arise from the conduct of its business activities. The \\nCompany establishes reserves for such matters when potential losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated. The \\nCompany believes the ultimate resolution of existing legal and regulatory matters will not have a material adverse effect on the \\nfinancial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. However, in light of the uncertainties inherent in these \\nmatters, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of one or more of these matters may have a material adverse effect on the \\nCompany’s results of operations for a particular period, and future changes in circumstances or additional information could result \\nin additional accruals or resolution in excess of established accruals, which could adversely affect the Company’s results of \\noperations, potentially materially.  \\nResidential Mortgage-Backed Securities Litigation  Starting in 2011, the Company and other large financial institutions have \\nbeen sued in their capacity as trustee for residential mortgage–backed securities trusts for losses arising out of the 2008 financial \\ncrisis. In the lawsuits brought against the Company, the investors allege that the Company’s banking subsidiary, U.S. Bank \\nNational Association (“USBNA”), as trustee caused them to incur substantial losses by failing to enforce loan repurchase \\nobligations and failing to abide by appropriate standards of care after events of default allegedly occurred. The plaintiffs in these \\nmatters seek monetary damages in unspecified amounts and most also seek equitable relief. \\nRegulatory Matters  The Company is continually subject to examinations, inquiries, investigations and other forms of regulatory \\nand governmental inquiry or scrutiny covering a wide range of issues in its financial services businesses including in areas of \\nheightened regulatory scrutiny, such as compliance, risk management, third-party risk management and consumer protection. In \\nsome cases, these matters are part of reviews of specified activities at multiple industry participants; in others, they are directed at \\nthe Company individually. For example, the Division of Enforcement of the SEC has been investigating U.S. Bancorp Fund \\nServices, LLC (“USBFS”), a subsidiary of USBNA, relating to its role providing fund administration services to a third-party \\ninvestment fund. This investment fund was advised by an investment adviser who engaged in fraud, and USBFS was not affiliated \\nwith the investment adviser and did not provide any advisory services to the fund. The Division of Enforcement has made a \\npreliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action against USBFS, and USBFS is in the process of \\nresponding to the SEC on this matter. The Company is cooperating fully with all pending examinations, inquiries and \\ninvestigations, any of which could lead to administrative or legal proceedings or settlements. Remedies in these proceedings or \\nsettlements may include fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in the Company’s business practices (which may increase the\\nCompany’s operating expenses and decrease its revenue). \\nOn February 9, 2024, the SEC announced a settlement with U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., resolving the previously disclosed \\ninquiry regarding record retention requirements relating to electronic business communications. Also, on March 19, 2024, the \\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) announced a settlement with USBNA resolving similar issues. The financial \\nimpact of the resolution of these matters was not material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\\nOutlook  Due to their complex nature, it can be years before litigation and regulatory matters are resolved. The Company may be \\nunable to develop an estimate or range of loss where matters are in early stages, there are significant factual or legal issues to be \\nresolved, damages are unspecified or uncertain, or there is uncertainty as to a litigation class being certified or the outcome of \\npending motions, appeals or proceedings. For those litigation and regulatory matters where the Company has information to \\ndevelop an estimate or range of loss, the Company believes the upper end of the range of reasonably possible losses in \\naggregate, in excess of any reserves established for matters where a loss is considered probable, will not be material to its \\nfinancial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company’s estimates are subject to significant judgment and \\nuncertainties, and the matters underlying the estimates will change from time to time. Actual results may vary significantly from the \\ncurrent estimates.\\n66 U.S. Bancorp\", metadata={'source': './reports/24Q1USBANK\\\\Q1-2024-Form-10-Q.pdf', 'page': 66}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='NOTE 16 Business Segments\\nWithin the Company, financial performance is measured by major lines of business based on the products and services provided to \\ncustomers through its distribution channels. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information \\nis prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company has \\nthe following reportable operating segments and functional activities in Treasury and Corporate Support: \\nWealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking  Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking provides core \\nbanking, specialized lending, transaction and payment processing, capital markets, asset management, and brokerage and investment \\nrelated services to wealth, middle market, large corporate, government and institutional clients. \\nConsumer and Business Banking  Consumer and Business Banking comprises consumer banking, small business banking and \\nconsumer lending. Products and services are delivered through banking offices, telephone servicing and sales, online services, direct \\nmail, ATM processing, mobile devices, distributed mortgage loan officers, and intermediary relationships including auto dealerships, \\nmortgage banks, and strategic business partners. \\nPayment Services  Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate, \\ngovernment and purchasing card services and merchant processing. \\nTreasury and Corporate Support  Treasury and Corporate Support includes the Company’s investment portfolios, funding, capital \\nmanagement, interest rate risk management, income taxes not allocated to business segments, including most investments in tax-\\nadvantaged projects, and the residual aggregate of those expenses associated with corporate activities that are managed on a \\nconsolidated basis. \\nBasis of Presentation  Business segment results are derived from the Company’s business unit profitability reporting systems by \\nspecifically attributing managed balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related income or expense. The allowance \\nfor credit losses and related provision expense are allocated to the business segments according to the volume and credit quality of the \\nloan balances managed, but with the impact of changes in economic forecasts recorded in Treasury and Corporate Support. Goodwill and \\nother intangible assets are assigned to the business segments based on the mix of business of an entity acquired by the Company. Within \\nthe Company, capital levels are evaluated and managed centrally; however, capital is allocated to the business segments to support \\nevaluation of business performance. Business segments are allocated capital on a risk-adjusted basis considering economic and \\nregulatory capital requirements. Generally, the determination of the amount of capital allocated to each business segment includes credit \\nallocations following a Basel III regulatory framework. Interest income and expense is determined based on the assets and liabilities \\nmanaged by the business segment. Because funding and asset/liability management is a central function, funds transfer-pricing \\nmethodologies are utilized to allocate a cost of funds used or credit for funds provided to all business segment assets and liabilities, \\nrespectively, using a matched funding concept. Also, each business unit is allocated the taxable-equivalent benefit of tax-exempt \\nproducts. The residual effect on net interest income of asset/liability management activities is included in Treasury and Corporate Support. \\nNoninterest income and expenses directly managed by each business segment, including fees, service charges, salaries and benefits, \\nand other direct revenues and costs are accounted for within each segment’s financial results in a manner similar to the consolidated \\nfinancial statements. Occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by the business segments. Generally, operating \\nlosses are charged to the business segment when the loss event is realized in a manner similar to a loan charge-off. Noninterest expenses \\nincurred by centrally managed operations or business segments that directly support another business segment’s operations are charged \\nto the applicable business segment based on its utilization of those services, primarily measured by the volume of customer activities, \\nnumber of employees or other relevant factors. These allocated expenses are reported as net shared services expense within noninterest \\nexpense. Certain activities that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are \\nnot considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance are not charged to the business segments. The income or \\nexpenses associated with these corporate activities, including merger and integration charges, are reported within the Treasury and \\nCorporate Support business segment. Income taxes are assessed to each business segment at a standard tax rate with the residual tax \\nexpense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support. \\nDesignations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating \\nperformance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to the Company’s diverse customer base. \\nDuring 2024  and 2023 , certain organization and methodology changes were made, including the Company combining its Wealth \\nManagement and Investment Services and Corporate and Commercial Banking lines of businesses to create the Wealth, Corporate, \\nCommercial and Institutional Banking line of business during the third quarter of 2023 .
